                On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta, a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[397][398][399][400] Anjali decided to leave her medical career following their marriage.[401] They have two children: Sara and Arjun.[402][403] Tendulkar lives in a bungalow in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra.[404]

Tendulkar is a Hindu.[405] He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha[406] and of the guru Sathya Sai Baba, whom he visited for the first time in 1997.[407][408][409] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[410][411]
